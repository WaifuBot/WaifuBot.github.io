	{
		"Q": "How do I claim a waifu?",
		"A": "You can claim one by typing out <prefix>claim <name>. Diacritics are ignored. If the name is only two words then you can type them in any order."
	},
	{
		"Q": "What's 'Type' on my waifu's view page?",
		"A": "Type is a 'rarity' of sorts, I guess. Alpha (α) is the most common, Zeta (ζ) is the most rare. Characters of a higher type will have a decreased interaction cooldown."
	},
	{
		"Q": "How do I earn WeebPoints?",
		"A": "You can either send waifus to work with <prefix>work <waifuId> or use <prefix>daily. The former will allow you to work your waifus, the latter will allow you to claim your daily WeebPoints. You can also get WeebPoints by voting on DBL (\"dailyvote\" command!)."
	},
	{
		"Q": "Why can't I claim a waifu?",
		"A": "If the bot does not respond then the spawn was probably invalidated; spawns over 2 days old are automatically cleaned. If it DOES respond, then you probably got the name wrong. MAL has the name romanized a bit strangely, if you do not remember then you can do <prefix>lookup <name> to get an idea of what the name is."
	},
	{
		"Q": "What can I spend WeebPoints on?",
		"A": "Do <prefix>shop in order to browse a gallery of shop items. Badges require that you own 80% of the characters in the corresponding series; quotes require that you own the character associated with them."
	},
	{
		"Q": "What's up with this \"Ranking\" stuff?",
		"A": "You can rank waifus on the global leaderboard. Do <prefix>lookup <name> to find their ID, then do <prefix> rate <1-10 rating> <waifuId> in order to rate a waifu. You can then do <prefix>rankings to take a look at the waifu leaderboard."
	},
	{
		"Q": "So about this configurability...",
		"A": "If you have the \"Manage Server\" permission (i.e. Administrator), you can set the server\"s prefix and spawn channel. Do <prefix>setprefix <prefix> in order to set the prefix; do <prefix>setspawnchannel <#channel> in order to set where waifus will spawn."
	},
	{
		"Q": "What's up with the stats in \"view\" command?",
		"A": "Nothing special, yet..."
	},
	{
		"Q": "How do waifus spawn?",
		"A": "Waifus have a 2% chance of spawning every time a message is sent. Waifus will not spawn if a previous waifu had spawned less than a minute before."
	},
	{
		"Q": "I've claimed a waifu, what can I do with them now?",
		"A": "You can interact, trade, and fight. Take a look at the help command for more details."
	},
	{
		"Q": "Isn't this bot a bit boring?",
		"A": "Yeah, it is. I am still working on it. Do <prefix>suggest <idea> to suggest an idea!"
	},
	{
		"Q": "Can I have a character added to the bot?",
		"A": "Yeah. Use <prefix>suggestcharacter <MAL url>. I'll add the character if they aren't obscure."
	},
	{
		"Q": "what if i automate ur bot xd xd",
		"A": "bad things will habben"
	},
	{
		"Q": "Wait why isn't this open source???",
		"A": "It would be if the code wasn't ugly as sin."
	},
	{
		"Q": "What the hell is CSI or Cumulative Stats Index?",
		"A": "It's just an average of all four stats. I just call it CSI to give it a name lol"
